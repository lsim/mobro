# Introduction

This is a learner project. The goal was for me to get some hands on experience with angular2/typescript/scss/BEM along
with the tool chain that go with those technologies.

What it actually does is to allow browsing and visualization of a database schema by means of Force-directed graph 
rendering based on a typescript port of [springy](https://github.com/dhotson/springy). 

At the time of writing, this project can only pull data from a commercial source (at my place of work). I might change
that so that more hierarchies can be visualized.

The project itself is based on [this angular2 seed project](https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed). Material colors 
came from [here](https://github.com/danlevan/google-material-color).
